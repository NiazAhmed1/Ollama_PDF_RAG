# Ollama_PDF_RAG

 Ollama PDF RAG with Langchain and Streamlit
This project implements PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Langchain and Streamlit. It allows users to upload PDF files, select a locally available model through Ollama, and interact with the content of the PDF by querying it in a chat interface. The responses are generated based on the content of the uploaded PDF.

The user interface (UI) is built using Streamlit, making it easy and interactive for users to upload PDFs, select models, and chat with the document.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
PDF Upload: Upload any PDF document, which is displayed below the uploader as a series of images (one image per page).
Model Selection: Choose from available models in Ollama installed on your local system to process the queries.
Conversational Interface: Ask questions related to the PDF content, and receive concise, context-aware responses. The interaction is displayed in a chat-like format.
